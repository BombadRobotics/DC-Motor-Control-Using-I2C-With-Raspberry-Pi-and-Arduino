# DC-Motor-Control-Using-I2C-With-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino
This was a class project I'm sharing where a DC motor is controlled using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to communicate together via the I2C protocol. 
The Arduino receives inputs from a push-button and an analog potentiometer and sends that over to the Raspberry Pi which it takes to either turn on or off the overall
'system' or to adjust the speed of the motor.
